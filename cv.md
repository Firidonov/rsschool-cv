### _Code Example_ ###

DESCRIPTION:<br>
You are the greatest chef on earth. No one boils eggs like you! Your restaurant is always full of guests, who love your boiled eggs. But when there is a greater order of boiled eggs, you need some time, because you have only one pot for your job. How much time do you need?

Your Task<br>
Implement a function, which takes a non-negative integer, representing the number of eggs to boil. It must return the time in minutes (integer), which it takes to have all the eggs boiled.

Rules<br>
   - you can put at most 8 eggs into the pot at once
   - it takes 5 minutes to boil an egg
   - we assume, that the water is boiling all the time (no time to heat up)
   - for simplicity we also don't consider the time it takes to put eggs into the pot or get them out of it

```
import math
def cooking_time(eggs):
    division = eggs / 8
    integer_division = eggs // 8
    if division == 0:
        return 0
    if division < 1:
        return 5
    elif eggs % 8 == 0:
        return integer_division * 5
    else:
        return math.floor(division) * 5 + 5
```
